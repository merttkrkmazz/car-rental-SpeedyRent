🚗 SpeedyRent – Car Rental System

📌 Overview  
SpeedyRent is a Java-based car rental management system developed as part of a university software engineering project.  
The system enables users to search available cars, make reservations, and manage returns, while administrators can maintain the car catalog and oversee booking operations.  

✨ Features  
- 🔑 User registration, login, and authentication  
- 🚘 Car catalog management (add, update, delete, search)  
- 📅 Reservation and return workflows  
- 🛠️ Admin panel for monitoring rental operations  
- 📦 Modular architecture for scalability and maintainability  

🛠️ Technologies  
- Java (OOP, Modular Architecture)  
- SQL (Relational Database, Queries for Search & Booking)  
- UML & Use Case Diagrams for system design  
- SRS Documentation for requirements specification
